# movie_recommendation_system

Recommender Systems are an important aspect of Machine Learning algorithms that offer "Relevant" / similar suggestions to users.

Amazon,Youtube,Netflix all work oon recommendation systems where the system recommends the next video or product based on the user's previous activity (**Content-based Filtering**) or based on activities and others preferences (**Colloborative Filtering**).

This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that will demonstarate a variety of movie recommendation systems for the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/).

The following will be done:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
2. Building Recommendation System
  a. Memory-based Colloborative Filtering
  b. Content based Recommender System - with the Tfidf algorithm
  c. SVD Model
